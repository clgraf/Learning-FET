		// Sample code snippet to understand Prototype in JavaScript
		
		/* 
		   JavaScript is referred to as a prototype-based language.
		   
		   The functions in JavaScript are objects and they contain methods and properties. 
		   Some of the common methods are apply() and call() and some of the common properties are length and constructor. 
		   
		   Another property of the function objects is prototype. 
		   Prototype is a property that gets created as soon as you define the function. Its initial value is an empty object. 
		   If object does have its own property and the prototype also has one with the same name then the own property takes precedence over the prototype's.
