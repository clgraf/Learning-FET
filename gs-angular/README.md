For getting hands dirty with Angular.

## Getting Started with Angular 2 for TypeScript

* Quick Setup Instructions
	- [Download Latest NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) (For example, I tried with version: v6.2.1 - includes npm 3.9.3)
	- Open a command prompt in the project's root directory
	- Type: "npm install" (installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file)
	- Type: "npm start" (launches the TypeScript compiler to compile the application and wait for changes)
	- Finally, access application in browser @ http://localhost:3000
